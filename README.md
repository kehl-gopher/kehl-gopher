🚀 **Backend Engineer | Go Dev | Blockchain Enthusiast**  
Hi, I’m a backend engineer specializing in **high-performance Go services**, building resilient APIs, distributed systems, and scalable infrastructure. I write clean, efficient, and testable code that ships — fast.

💡 I’m obsessed with system design, microservices architecture, and diving deep into concurrency patterns. Whether it's optimizing DB queries, or architecting multi-tenant APIs  I make backend magic happen.

🔗 Currently exploring the intersection of **blockchain + backend engineering**, where blockchain meets Go. Smart contract integrations? Chain data indexing? Let’s go.

🛠️ **Tech I'm fluent in**:  
`Go (Golang)` • `PostgreSQL` • `Redis` • `Docker` •  `CI/CD` • `FastAPI` • `Microservices` • `REST` • `Blockchain` (early stages)

🧠 Always learning, always shipping, and building the backend of the future.
